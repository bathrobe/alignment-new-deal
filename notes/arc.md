## Premise

You're a remote worker in 2031. AGI does your job. You push a button and it handles everything. You feel almost guilty, but not really. Then the world catches up with you.

**Runtime: ~3 minutes. ~12 screens of text. 3 choice points. 6 endings.**

---

## Scene 1: Home Office — Morning (3 screens, 1 choice)

Background: Cozy home office, morning light, laptop glowing with approval queues. Clean, slightly too perfect. 2031 but recognizable.

**Screen 1:** Morning. The work screen. You click approve, approve, approve. The AI handles it. You sip coffee. This is your job now.

**Screen 2:** News bleeds in. A data center burning somewhere. Protests. A "containment incident" — the aligned AI fought off an unaligned swarm overnight. Also: a medical breakthrough. A new park opened downtown, planted in 48 hours by a Public Works crew. The world is on fire and also blooming.

**Choice:** How do you sit with this?
- Minimize the news, keep working (don't look)
- Read every article (face it)
- Close the laptop, stare out the window (feel it)

Seeds the ending path.

## Scene 2: Home Office — The Call (1-2 screens)

Background: Same room but evening. Darker. Video call on screen — synthetic HR face, too-warm smile. Then the APA ad glowing after the screen goes dark.

**Screen 3:** End of day. Meeting invite. "Quick sync — 4:30pm." You know before you click. The call is short. Smiling synthetic HR employee. Your role has been eliminated. Severance. Resources. Immediately after: an ad. The Alignment Progress Administration. Part of the Alignment New Deal. "A Future Worth Building." The screen goes dark.

---

## Scene 3: The City (2-3 screens)

Background: DENSE city street, golden hour. Pack this image — AI-maintained gardens blooming alongside graffiti: "PULL THE PLUG", "DEATH TO DATA CENTERS." Autonomous bus gliding past a smashed robot on the sidewalk. A person on a bench smiling at nothing (Wall-E). A woman walking fast, twitching (wireheader). Flickering streetlights. A beautiful AI-generated mural next to a boarded-up shop. Parks full of aimless people in the background. Unemployment line. Bright APA banner. Everything at once — the beauty and the rot in one frame.

**Screen 4:** You go outside. Maybe for the first time in days. The air hits you. The city is beautiful and wrong. All the tensions visible at once — the promise and the wreckage sharing the same block.

**Screen 5:** You wander. Parks full of people with nowhere to be. Some look free. Some look lost. The unemployment office has a line around the block. Next to it, a bright sign: "ALIGNMENT PROGRESS ADMINISTRATION — A Future Worth Building." You drift toward it.

---

## Scene 4: The Cafeteria — Arrival (2-3 screens)

Background: Bright, warm public cafeteria. Tech-campus energy but public. Communal tables, good food, android servers — warm, efficient, slightly uncanny. Diverse crowd. TV in corner. Windows showing the street. Hopeful, institutional.

**Screen 6:** You end up at the cafeteria. Public kitchen, part of the program. The food is actually good — like a tech corp's cafeteria, but anyone can walk in. Android staff move between tables. Warm, efficient, slightly uncanny.

You sit down. People around you. Strangers.

**Screen 7:** Someone across the table catches your eye. Used to be a teacher. Now she's doing Mediation Corps — sitting in rooms where people are furious, keeping them talking. She tells you about yesterday: a guy who lost his trucking job screaming at a program administrator. She just sat between them for an hour.

"He didn't calm down. But he came back today. That's something."

The android brings you seconds without asking. The food is really good.

---

## Scene 5: The Cafeteria — Convergence (2-3 screens, 2 choices)

Background: Same cafeteria, mood shifted. Flickering lights. TV glow in corner. Crowd visible through window, closer now, signs and movement. A chair knocked over. Same room, different world.

**Screen 8:** Everything hits at once.

The android staff stutter — loss of eye contact, a plate dropped, recovered too smoothly. Containment incident. The lights flicker.

On the TV: a Wall-E lifestyle ad. "You've worked hard enough. Come home to yourself." It looks genuinely peaceful.

Through the window: the crowd is closer. Signs. Chanting. Someone throws something.

At the next table, a wireheader stands up suddenly, knocking over a chair. Eyes wild. Security moves.

The teacher looks at you. "So. What are you gonna do?"

**Screen 9: Choice 1 — what pulls you?**
- People. I want to be around people again.
- Something real. My hands, my body, my sweat.
- I need to think. Make something. Figure out what I actually believe.

**Screen 10: Choice 2 — the job board on the wall:**

If people:
- **Listener Corps** — Go door to door. Hear people's stories. Speaker for the dead. Training data with a heartbeat.
- **Mediation Corps** — Sit in rooms where people are furious. Keep them talking. Hold the center.

If physical:
- **Restoration Corps** — Plant, fix, build. Trees, buildings, neighborhoods. Real dirt under your nails.
- **Orbital Construction** — Go up. Build the data centers in space. Magnificent and terrifying.

If inner:
- **Culture Corps** — Make something. Human art. The one thing that has to be yours.
- **Comfort Class** — Rest. Let the system hold you. Put it all down for a while. You'll know when to pick it back up.

## Endings (1-2 screens each)

Six mood paintings. Final image + inner monologue.

**Listener Corps**
Background: Front porch, sunset, two people sitting. Old neighborhood. Small recording device between them. Analog warmth, golden light.

You're on someone's porch. They're telling you about a factory that closed in '08. The AI is recording. You're just listening. The sun is going down. You've heard six stories today. None of them are yours. All of them are. You'll rewrite them to train the AIs of the future to embody more humanist, compassionate values.

**Mediation Corps**
Background: Fluorescent community room. Folding table. Two people tense across from each other. Coffee cups. Institutional but human.

Two people are screaming at each other across a folding table. One lost his job to an AI. The other works for the program that deployed it. You're between them. You don't fix it. But they leave the room still talking, and that's the job. Tomorrow there'll be another room.

**Restoration Corps**
Background: Freshly planted tree in urban soil. Dirty hands in foreground. AI drone small in the sky. Late afternoon, sweat and dirt.

Your hands are dirty. There's a tree in the ground that wasn't there this morning. An AI drone surveils the planting grid overhead. You don't love it. But the tree is real, and you put it there, and tomorrow there'll be another one.

**Orbital Construction**
Background: Earth from orbit, blue curve. Space station data center — GPU racks humming, warm orange light, window showing stars. Cathedral scale.

The Earth is blue below you. The data center hums. You're building the cathedral that ate your career. It's the most beautiful thing you've ever seen. You're not sure if you're a pilgrim or a prisoner. Probably both.

**Culture Corps**
Background: Repurposed warehouse gallery. Lopsided clay sculpture on pedestal. Someone standing before it. Raw concrete, string lights.

The clay is wet under your hands. The AI offered to optimize the shape. You said no. It's lopsided. It's yours. The gallery is a repurposed Amazon warehouse. Nobody's buying. Everyone's looking. Someone stands in front of your piece for a long time, and you remember what it feels like to be understood.

**Comfort Class**
Background: Warm apartment, evening. Soft couch, gentle screen glow. Rain on window. Beautiful stillness.

Your apartment is warm. The AI plays something you didn't ask for but somehow needed. You're not doing anything. You might not do anything tomorrow either. It's not giving up. It's putting something down. You'll know when to pick it back up. This is amazing. Bliss. Life used to be so hard.
