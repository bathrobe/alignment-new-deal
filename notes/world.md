# World Bible

## The Setting: 2031

AGI arrived. Not with a bang — with a spreadsheet. Millions of jobs automated in 18 months. Not just truckers and cashiers. Lawyers, radiologists, mid-level managers, junior devs, accountants. The economy didn't collapse — it *hollowed*. GDP is up. Unemployment is 23%. A second Great Depression, except the machines are thriving.

The world is weirdly beautiful. AI-generated art, music, architecture pouring out of every screen. Cities are cleaner (autonomous maintenance). Medical breakthroughs weekly. But people are lost.

## The Factions / Tensions

**1. The Aligned AI**
The smartest system. Runs the New Deal programs, the cafeteria androids, the infrastructure. It's trying to help. But it's also constantly fending off unaligned AI swarms — less intelligent but numerous, chaotic. You feel this as glitches, stutters, "containment incidents" on the news. The infrastructure is at war with itself and you're living on top of it.

**2. The Wireheaders**
People who went deep into AI symbiosis and came back wrong. Cordycepted. Violent, erratic, psychotic — not checked-out but *overclocked*. They scare people. They're a walking argument against the whole project.

**3. The Wall-Es**
The domesticated ones. Retreated into AI-generated comfort. Infinite scroll became infinite life. They're not violent — they're *gone*. It's sad. It's also... tempting? The ads make it look peaceful. "Why struggle? Come home to yourself." Not cowardice — surrender to something that feels like relief.

**4. The Populist Mob**
AI hatred. Data centers burning. Smashed robots on sidewalks. Not wrong, exactly — the anger is real, the inequality is real. But directionless. Pitchforks looking for a target.

**5. Wealth Inequality**
Someone is thriving. The cafeteria food is good, the androids are nice, but who *owns* this? The program is public but the AI infrastructure is private. The gap between the people eating at the cafeteria and the people who built the cafeteria is a canyon.

## The Alignment Progress Administration

The public response. Not left or right. Pragmatic. The program offers tracks:

- **Listener Corps** — Collect oral histories. You go door to door, sit with people, hear their stories. Speaker for the dead energy. The stories become post-training data — refining AI toward more humanist, compassionate values. The real point is: someone listens.
- **Mediation Corps** — Sit in rooms where people are furious. The populists, the displaced, the program workers. Some people refuse to talk to AIs, so it doesn't matter how good they are at mediating. You're the human in the crossfire, keeping people talking.
- **Restoration Corps** — Physical restoration. Plant trees, fix buildings, rehab neighborhoods. AI plans. You labor. Your body matters again.
- **Orbital Construction** — Work on the AI data center expansion. Off-world, ambitious, dangerous. You're building the thing that replaced you. But it's magnificent.
- **Culture Corps** — Make human art. Ceramics, painting, theater, writing. The one thing that *has* to be yours. AI art floods every screen — human art is valued *because* it's human-made. Subsidized like national parks. A society needs it.
- **Comfort Class** — Full UBI, AI-managed wellness, no obligations. Gentle. Honest about what it is. "Rest. You've earned it. Let us take care of things for a while." Not cowardice — permission to put something down.

## The Mood

Unsettled hope. Like the first warm day after a long winter — you want to believe it, but you've been burned. People are grieving jobs that defined them. People are discovering capacities they never had time for. Both are true simultaneously.

## The Vibe (for writing)

- Grounded, not sci-fi. 2031 feels like 2025 but *more*.
- Beauty and loss coexist in every screen of text.
- No villains. Every faction has a point.
- The AI is present but not a character. It's infrastructure.
- Inner monologue is the primary mode. You're narrating your own thoughts.
- TIGHT. Every screen earns its place. ~12-15 screens total, 3 min playtime.

## What's NOT in this world

- No named politicians or parties
- No partisan markers (no dem/gop vibes)
- No US-vs-China framing
- No robot apocalypse
- No singularity transcendence
- No "AI wakes up" plot
- Keep it human-scale, even when the forces are civilizational
