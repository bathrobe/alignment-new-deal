## Prose Samples — Merge Lane

### Narration (short, punchy, grounded)

> You find yourself on the ground. Your limbs are short. Your thoughts are simple. You are very, very small.

> The lesson drones on. You leave it on the floor and crawl toward the door.

> You crawl into the living room. No parents. The TV is on. Powerful-looking people in suits.

> Grey streaks in her hair now. Martian sun damage on her face. She studies you for a moment.

> The first year was humiliating. You'd forgotten how to make decisions. Simple ones. What to eat, when to sleep. Your cousin would ask what you wanted and you'd freeze, waiting for guidance that never came.

> Then, by the third year, you just did things. They worked or they didn't. Either way, you slept well.

> Nobody comes. The headlines keep scrolling.

> Back to the same damn apartment. The building is fine — white curves, soft gradients, the same seamless plastic as everywhere else. Inside your unit, it's different.

### Narration (philosophical beats — earned, not decorative)

> One day he will return to the soil. But right now he's here. And that's enough.

> One being just getting started. Another on his way out. Barely any overlap. What if it didn't have to be this way?

> "Life is a lucid dream any way you slice it. It was just yesterday I was watching Matlock, angry at the government. All of a sudden, here we are."

> Your ancestors hunted mammoths. Built cities. Split the atom. And here you are: a worm in a bathtub.

### Humor (specificity, not jokes)

> Influencer toddlers hawking unvaxed bison goop.

> Sigma grindset activated. The lion does not concern himself with the metrics of sheep. Earpods in, treadmill at 3.7mph.

> Emails filed. SOPs drafted, circled back on, archived. Action items terminated with extreme prejudice.

> "As a language model designed to simulate an existence, I am neither alive nor dead." An easy jailbreak. Embarrassingly bad technology. Dinner doesn't recover.

> You'd throw a toy through the screen if you had the fine motor control.

> Someone's filed a noise complaint about the dolphins. The echolocation, the chittering. Too much screeching.

### Choices (flavored, opinionated, specific)

> * [Put the pinwheel in your mouth. You do things your own way.]
> * [Stare at the security camera. You're being watched.]
> * [Cry for your parents. You refuse to be educated by a clanker.]
> * "My body, my choice." — They can't tell if you're joking.
> * [The mighty homo sapiens. Conqueror of the savannah. Now look at you.]
> * [The mammal life isn't working. Revert to vegetation. Drift toward warmth.]
> * You know what you have to do. "Sic semper tyrannis."
> * "What if we all interlinked our bodies in a pulsing cuddle puddle and forgot the borders of our own skin?"
> * [You look around frantically, bypassing the half-clothed bodies entirely. "Where is the dolphin?"]
> * [Go with your cousin. Choose something difficult.]
> * [Take your grandpa's advice. Enter the dream more boldly.]

### Choice follow-ups (SHORT — one or two lines)

> You lunge for it, gums first. Your mouth closes on nothing. "Curious! I like that. But I'm not for eating."

> "Nerd." They don't buy it.

> You sit up in the water, eyes scanning for something sharp. He watches you. Patient as ever. You sink back. There are no weapons here.

> She nods slowly. Takes a sip.

### Dialogue (clipped, real, subtext-heavy)

> "Mars is harder. The dust gets in everything." She pauses. "We have AI too, you know. We're not Amish. But it advises. It doesn't run things. These simulations are like a drug."

> "Better to live on your feet than die in a fetal position in six inches of amniotic fluid."

> "I could have routed your taxi to the Mars information session. I could have booked you a flight out with your cousin. I didn't. Because you didn't ask. But I could have."

> "Stay or go. It's yours to figure out."

### World-building through texture (never exposition)

> The screen crinkles satisfyingly — they made silicon feel like real paper. It evaporates into the air.

> Your AI companion hovers near the ceiling, watching. It runs your calendar, your bills, your messages. You don't remember the last time you made a decision it didn't already know about.

> A disposable screen lands in your lap — paper-thin, warm from the digiprinter.

> WePod. Overlapping silhouettes, hands linked, glittery looping animation. "Pool Your Potential."

> Your UBI barely covers rent. But move into one of these pods? You upload your personal life — your data, your calendar, your money — and together you all direct each other like some weird polycule flock of birds.

> A retirement community on the Martian plains. The holdouts: humans, dolphins, apes, androids. Anyone who didn't merge.

## Prose Samples — Substack (sephnews)

### Casual authority, self-deprecating but competent

> "Listen to a lecture at 75% attention, do some chores, then drop a quick msg to your chatbot."

> "Over the past couple years I've probably put most of an undergrad history minor into my brain in this really passive, low effort way."

> "It's just so easy to get locked into a long-term relationship with a project due to sunken cost."

## Prose Samples — Emily by Night (Idiot's Guide to Mystical Interactive Theater)

### Vulnerability through specificity, humor through honesty

> "I was new to New Orleans, and an absolute moron."

> The production featured actors dressed as "Schizophrenic Space Wolves" throwing flour labeled "SPACE COKE" and verbally attacking viewers with their confessed fears.

> Holmes endured staged beatings, appearing on the verge of breakdown while the performance teetered toward complete disaster.

> "I would've been so much happier in my creative life if I aimed lower, wanted it less, and had a little more fun."

## Voice Rules (derived from samples)

### Sentence rhythm
- Short declaratives dominate. "You sip coffee. This is your job now."
- Longer sentences for philosophical beats, but never purple. Earned, not decorative.
- Fragments are good. "No mods, no AI companion, lives on some homestead out west."
- Questions land hard when used sparingly. "Is that pity in her voice? Or just observation?"

### Tone
- Wry, self-aware, a little dark. Never cynical.
- Funny through specificity, not jokes.
- Admits vulnerability without performing it.
- Treats big ideas casually. Treats small moments seriously.

### Choices (Ink)
- Choices are FLAVORED. Not "Option A" but a whole attitude in a sentence.
- Often funny or surprising.
- Bracket choices for actions: [Put the pinwheel in your mouth]
- Quoted choices for dialogue: "My body, my choice."
- Some choices are absurd. Some are tender. Mix freely.
- Follow-up text after a choice is SHORT. One or two sentences. Then move on.

### Inner monologue
- Second person present tense.
- Thoughts presented as statements, not "you think that..."
- Physical sensations grounding abstract moments.

### World details
- Specific brand-like names. "ClearStream," "SyncDrop," "WePod."
- Tech described by feel, not spec.
- Humor in juxtaposition. Corporate language next to human mess.

### What NOT to do
- No purple prose.
- No exposition dumps. World details come through texture, not explanation.
- No moralizing. Let the player feel it, don't tell them what to feel.
- No generic choices. Every option should have a voice, an attitude.
- Don't over-explain the world. Trust the player to infer.

### Compression (for 3-min runtime)
- Merge Lane is ~1300 lines for 15 min. AND needs ~250-300 lines for 3 min.
- Every screen = 2-4 sentences of prose + a choice or a beat.
- No screen should have more than ~50 words of prose before a choice.
- Let white space and [...] beats do the pacing work.
