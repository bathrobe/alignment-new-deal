## Prompt Prefix

Paste at START of every image prompt:

```
Detailed graphic novel illustration with WPA screenprint influence. Bold clean
linework over flat color fields, but with enough environmental detail to tell a
story — objects on desks, texture on walls, plants growing through concrete.
Near-future 2031 setting: familiar but subtly alien. Think Ben Shahn meets
Moebius meets risograph poster art.

Limited but rich color palette: dusty teals, warm terra cotta, muted gold, cool
slate. Colors printed in flat overlapping layers like a 4-color screenprint — subtle
halftone texture where colors overlap. Strong value contrast. Atmospheric lighting
with clear light source direction.

WORLD DETAILS: This is 2031 after AGI. The built environment is a collision of
eras — old brick with fire escapes and graffiti next to towers with flowing
parametric facades (Zaha Hadid meets alien intelligence). New architecture is
clearly buildings, just with impossible smooth curved geometry — twisted glass
and composite, NOT organic creatures or tentacles. Drones are small, flat,
seed-shaped — no propellers, they just float. Vehicles are rounded autonomous
pods. Mix decay and hope: graffiti on old walls, ivy climbing scaffolding, next
to sleek parametric infrastructure. Skylines mix crumbling old buildings with
impossible new ones.

First-person POV from someone present in the scene — no visible player character,
but camera positioned where a person would naturally be (sitting, standing, walking).
Environments feel lived-in, human-scale, grounded.

CRITICAL: Pure scene only — absolutely no UI elements, no text, no labels, no buttons,
no title bars, no interface chrome of any kind. This is a background image, not a
screenshot. No split panels, no dividers, no sidebars. No people facing the camera.

COMPOSITION: Keep important elements away from extreme edges of the frame. The image
may be cropped on any edge depending on viewport.

## Prompt Suffix

Paste at END of every prompt:

```
4:3 aspect ratio. Style: graphic novel illustration with WPA screenprint aesthetic.
Bold linework, flat color layers with subtle halftone overlap, limited palette.
Near-future 2031 — a collision of decay, grime, hope, and parametric AGI-designed
architecture. New buildings have flowing Zaha Hadid curves — NOT organic creatures
or tentacles. Drones are small flat seed-shapes (NOT quadcopters, NOT animals).
Detailed environments, not minimalist. No text, no UI, no interface elements anywhere
in frame.
```

> The beauty and loss coexist. A park planted by a Public Works crew, gorgeous

## Tech Design Language

**Drones / flying bots:**
- Small, flat, seed-shaped or skipping-stone-shaped
- No visible propellers or rotors — they just float
- Faintly luminous, smooth surfaces
- NOT quadcopters, NOT animals, NOT manta rays, NOT military

**Vehicles:**
- Rounded autonomous pods, no visible driver
- Soft edges, smooth composite surfaces
- Mix of sizes — personal pods and larger transit

**Buildings (new):**
- Flowing parametric facades — think Zaha Hadid co-designed with AGI
- Twisted glass and composite, smooth curves, impossible geometry
- Clearly BUILDINGS (not creatures, not tentacles, not organic growths)
- Exist alongside old brick, concrete, graffiti
- May glow softly from within at night

**Buildings (old):**
- Decay, grime, wheat-paste posters, graffiti
- Ivy and plants reclaiming surfaces
- Scaffolding, patched repairs
- Still inhabited, still alive

**Interiors:**
- Subtle next-gen touches: transparent displays, organic-shaped furniture
- Lighting that seems to come from surfaces rather than fixtures
- Plants integrated into architecture (living walls, desk gardens)
- Mix of old furniture (wood tables, worn chairs) and alien-smooth new tech

## Style Pitfalls

**What DOESN'T work:**
- "Retro poster" alone → too flat, loses detail needed for storytelling
- "Comic book" → too saturated, too much action energy
- "Cyberpunk" → wrong vibe entirely. This is warm, civic, not dystopian
- "Watercolor" → too loose, loses the bold graphic structure
- "Anime" or "manga" → wrong lineweight and color approach
- Current-gen tech (quadcopter drones, angular robots, visible screens)
- Too clean/utopian — needs grime and decay mixed with the hope

**What WORKS:**
- Reference "screenprint layers" for the color overlap effect
- "Graphic novel panel" for the linework density
- Specific environmental details ("coffee cups on the table", "a toolbox left open")
- Lighting language ("late afternoon light through industrial windows")
- "Risograph" for that textured-ink-on-paper quality
- Juxtaposition language ("crumbling brick wall beside an organic glass tower")
- Organic tech language ("manta-ray drone", "seed-pod vehicle", "grown not built")
